Got it — your README is **not rendering professionally on GitHub** because:

### ✅ GitHub does NOT support emojis inside headings like this:

```
## 🎬 **Cinema Ticket Booking System**
```

### ❌ Also GitHub does NOT style headings well when bold (`**`) is inside them.

### ❌ Subheadings with emojis before them sometimes break alignment.

### ❌ Extra HTML-like spacing causes inconsistent formatting.

---

# ✅ I will give you a **Professional, Clean, GitHub-Perfect README**

No rendering issues
No alignment issues
No bold-inside-heading issues
Emojis used safely
Headings clean and uniform
Spacing optimized for GitHub

# 🎬 Cinema Ticket Booking System

*A Full-Stack Java Web Application for Seamless Movie Ticket Reservations*

---

## 🧩 Overview

The **Cinema Ticket Booking System** is a full-stack web application that digitizes the movie ticket reservation process — from movie selection to payment and ticket generation.
It replicates functionality similar to **BookMyShow**, built entirely using **JSP**, **Servlets**, and **MySQL**.

This project includes:

* Java Servlets + JDBC backend
* JSP-based dynamic UI
* Razorpay Payment Integration
* Session & booking management

---

## 💡 Motivation

This project is designed to:

* Demonstrate Java EE and MVC architecture
* Build a modular and scalable backend
* Integrate Razorpay for real payment flow
* Improve MySQL relational query handling

The aim was to create a professional, maintainable, production-style ticket booking application.
